Assignment Calculator App
This Flutter application is a simple calculator that provides basic arithmetic operations. The user interface consists of a grid of buttons representing digits and operators. It features responsive design and color-coded buttons to enhance usability.

Features:
Buttons: A grid of buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, x, /), and special functions (AC, +/-, %, =).
Responsive Design: Buttons are arranged in a grid layout that adapts to the screen size.
Color-Coded: Operators are highlighted in amber, while other buttons have a blue-grey theme.
Extended Zero Button: The "0" button is wider to accommodate its frequent use.
Key Widgets Used:
MaterialApp: The root of the application.
Scaffold: Provides the basic structure of the app.
SafeArea: Ensures the UI is displayed within the visible screen area.
Column: Arranges the display and buttons vertically.
GridView: Creates a grid layout for the calculator buttons.
This project is a practical example for learning Flutter's grid and layout system, as well as managing state in a Flutter application.
